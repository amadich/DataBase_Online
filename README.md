# DataBase_Online
A new and interesting idea, creating a website with react, php and mySQL, and connecting to hosting databases outside GitHUB 🤯

###
In this way, we access the files on the hosting to complete the connection with the databases and thus send us information
```js
useEffect(() => {
    
    const url = "https://hostname.com/server/mySQL.php";
    Axios.get(url).then((response) => {
      setmyinfo(response.data);
    })
    
  }, [])
```
# Warning

Many people will see this error, and the reason is the combination of https and http
You must make sure that you are working on paid https hosting
